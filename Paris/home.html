            The history of Paris starts with a humble settlement by a tribe of Celtic fishermen in around 259 BC. Since
            then, it has enjoyed a long and illustrious history to become the thriving metropolis that it is today. Here
            is a
            brief roundup of some of the key events in the history of Paris.

            The area around L’Ile de la Cité was first settled around 259 BC, when the Parisii, who were a tribe of
            Celtic fishermen, discovered the fertile banks of the River Seine. They named their new home Lutetia. In 52
            BC, Julius Caesar’s Roman army took the city, and it became part of the Roman Empire, within the territory
            known as Gaul. It was later invaded by the Franks and Normans and became known as Lutetia Paris.

            In Medieval times, around 1200, work began on the fortifications, including the Louvre, which were to
            surround the medieval city. In the late 1300s, Paris, in common with the rest of Western Europe, was
            engulfed by the plague, known as the Black Death, which killed almost half of its entire population. It was
            in 1449 that the iconic figure of Joan of Arc at the head of the French army, defeated the English at
            Orléans. This ended almost ten years of Norman English control. They were finally driven from France in
            1453.

            In the late 15th century, as the Renaissance dawned, Paris became a thriving centre of science, art and
            architecture. A century later, however, rifts developed between the Protestant and Catholic communities,
            which led to the St. Bartholomew’s Day Massacre, which saw over 3000 Protestant Huguenots slaughtered in one
            day.

            In 1643, at the tender age of 5, Louis XIV was crowned King of France and went on to enjoy the longest reign
            of any monarch in the history of Europe. In 1774, Louis XVI began his fateful rule. Married to the young
            daughter of the powerful Austrian Empress Maria Theresa, Marie Antoinette, the couple became known for their
            decadence. Their political ineptitude and apparent indifference to the suffering of their people led to
            revolt. On July 14th 1789, Paris’s Bastille prison was stormed by an angry crowd and burnt to the ground,
            marking the start of the French Revolution. In 1793 the royal couple were sent to the guillotine and the
            first Republic of France was founded.

            A period of chaos ensued as the Revolutionaries continued their ‘reign of terror’ executing thousands of
            people. In 1804, a new leader emerged, as a revolutionary General by the name of Napoleon Bonaparte became
            Emperor. He led a period of military success, conquering much of North Africa, before being defeated at
            Waterloo in 1815.

            In 1870, the third Republic of France was declared and the institutions of democracy were first put in
            place. It began a period known as the Belle Époque, which was a time of great artistic and cultural
            achievement, when movements, such as impressionism, spread throughout the world, cementing the reputation of
            Paris as a cultural and artistic capital.

            In 1940, Paris was invaded by Nazi Germany, and was occupied by the Nazis for four years, until it was
            liberated by the Allies in 1944.
